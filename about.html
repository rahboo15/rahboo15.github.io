            	<p>Hello and welcome!  My name is Roy Hemmert and this is my blog.  Well, at least half of the blog is mine.  Here you will find "delicious" dishes, both food and technology dishes.  I mainly talk about the tech dishes, while my wife Heather talks about the food dishes.  You see, we love food.  So we started this blog in an effort to document our restaurant experiences in the Utah Valley area.  I also love technology, so I felt it appropriate to document my experiences with technologies too.  Hope you enjoy.</p>
